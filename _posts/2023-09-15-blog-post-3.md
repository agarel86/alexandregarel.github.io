**Abstract**: Our paper explores how female representation in mutual funds’ management teams affects their voting behavior. We find that women-led mutual funds are more likely to support environmental and social (ES) proposals, but not governance ones. This result is robust to controlling for possible self-selection of female managers in sustainable funds and fund family’s influence. While women-led mutual funds are also more likely to vote with management in firms headed by female CEOs, this does not conflict with their greater support to ES shareholder proposals. Overall, our results suggest that female representation in fund management teams influences their voting behavior on ES issues.
