**Abstract**: This paper examines the relationship between employee demographic diversity and firm performance measured by stock returns for a large sample of U.S. public companies. We use novel demographic data extracted from employeesâ€™ online profiles and resumes and focus on three key aspects of employee demographic diversity: age, gender, and ethnicity. We do not find evidence supportive of an outperformance associated with greater employee-diverse companies, neither using portfolio-sorting approaches nor cross-sectional and panel regressions. We also do not find significant associations between employee demographic diversity and ROE, gross profit, and labor productivity.
